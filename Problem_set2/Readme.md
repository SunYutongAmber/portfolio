# Project information
With the development of Non-Fungible Token, there are many related arts products created based on it, and CryptoPunks is one of the them [(Ante 2022)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438599.2022.2119564). [CryptoPunks](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/cryptopunks-cryptocats-and-cryptokitties-how-they-started-and-how-theyre-going/) are 24x24 pixel portraits that were originally offered by Larva Labs for free in June 2017. 

In this project, I aim to use the previous Cryptopunks price to predict the future price. 
In part I, I firstly visulize the data for explaination.
For Part II, I query Cryptopunks transaction data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/baotramduong/generate-nft-cryptopunks-with-dggan). This data set contains information about the transaction date, transaction price, transfer address, and the type of Cryptopunks. transaction price (eth) is set as Y variable, and the shift version of Y is set as X variable. I use X to classify and predict Y.
