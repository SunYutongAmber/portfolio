## Project Summary: [Summarize the Background/Motivation, Research Questions, Application Scenario (Data Source), Results, Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts of your project.]

- **Background and Motivation:** With the development of Non-Fungible Tokens, there are many related art products created based on them, and CryptoPunks is one of them. CryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel portraits created in 2017 (An example of Cryptopunks is shown in Figure 1. “What Is CryptoPunk - Zipmex” 2022). And they were created by Larva Labs and provide their users for free (Ante 2022). Users can now trade Cryptopunks on the secondary market, and different Cryptopunks will bring different Return on Investment (ROI). The ROI of Cryptopunks is influenced by many factors, including market factors, news and the characteristics of the Cryptopunks themselves, etc (Kampakis and Schaar 2022). However, the gender and skin tone factors are not well studied yet regarding the ROI of Cryptopunks. In this research, I will explore the question: how do the gender and skin tone factors influence the prediction of the ROI of Cryptopunks?  It is important to explore the impact of different factors on the ROI of Cryptopunks. Because we need to use these factors to predict the market ROI of Cryptopunks and to make investment decisions accordingly. In addition, the gender and skin tone factors are also important for Cryptopunks' ethical issue, we also want to explore whether the difference in Cryptopunks’ gender and skin tone will influence people’s valuation of them, and whether there is discrimination regarding the gender and skin tone of Cryptopunks.


- **Research Question:** How do the gender and skin tone factors influence the prediction of the ROI of Cryptopunks?  

- **The discussion of literature under intellectual merits and practical impacts:** 
  - **Intellectual Merits:** 
  - There is much literature exploring the influence factors of Cryptopunks’ return. For example, Kong and Lin summarize some literature that analyzes the influence factor in the NFT market, and they conclude that the price and return are influenced greatly by factors like other traditional markets’ behavior, the token’s rarity, and the aesthetic of people (Kong and Lin 2021). Urom, Ndubuisi, and Guesmi use the quantile regression model to predict the Cryptopunks return with the market volume and market uncertainty risk index and other markets’ behavior as the predictor variable, and they conclude that these factors are good predictors, especially under extreme market conditions. And they also find that increasing in bitcoin market price will reduce the return of NFT market (Urom, Ndubuisi, and Guesmi 2022). Previous studies on Cryptopunks’ returns mostly focus on their relation to other markets and the cryptocurrency market. However, these papers do not analyze specific attributes like gender and skin tone’s influence on Cryptopunk return. Our research will contribute to the literature with gender and skin tone factors’ influence on Cryptopunks’ return analysis. 
  - Many machine learning models are applied to predict the price of Cryptopunks. For example, Kraeussl and Tugnetti summarize and compare the literature on predicting models of Cryptopunks’ value and discuss their application scenarios (Kraeussl and Tugnetti 2022). Kampakis and Schaar explore the influence of the rarity of the attributes of Cryptopunks’ images on Cryptopunks’ price using the hedonic regression model, and they find that the rarity of attributes of Cryptopunk has a positive influence on the price of Cryptopunks (Kampakis and Schaar 2022). And Ho et al. study the influence of the utility factor for NFT price prediction using XGBoost regression, and they find that the Crtptopunks that bring higher utility for people are valued higher (Ho et al. 2022).  However, most of these regression models are used for Cryptopunks’ price prediction, and no research predicts the return on investment (ROI) of Cryptopunks using Ridge Regression. Our research will contribute to the literature by using the Ridge model for the prediction of Cryptopunks’ return rather than price.
  - In addition, some research discusses the ethical issue of Cryptppunks. For example, Zhang et al. discuss and summarize the gender and skin tone’s influence on the difference in Cryptopunks’ price by visualization (Zhang et al. 2022). In addition, many papers apply the prediction of Cryptopunks’ price to analyze the ethical issue of Cryptopunks quantitively. For example, Loi and Tang use the Hedonic Pricing model to predict the price of Cryptopunks with many facial features like gender and “have a nose or not”, and they conclude that male Cryptopunk in general has a higher price (Loi and Tang 2022). In addition, Nguyen analyzes the influence of skin tone on the price of Cryptopunk using hedonic regression and concludes that there is some discrimination in pricing regarding the skin tone type in the Cryptopunk market (Nguyen 2022). However, no research applies prediction of Cryptopunks’ ROI to analyze the Cryptopunks’ethic issue yet. In this research, we combine two factors, skin tone and gender factors, in predicting the ROI of Cryptopunks and discussing the ethical issue. Our research combines the two factors with the previous price of Cryptopunks to predict the return. The literature structure is shown in Figure 1 in the Splotlight section.


  - **Practical Use:** Our research explores the impact of the gender and skin tone factors on the prediction ROI of Cryptopunks. And the research results could be used by investors when making investment decision in the Cryptopunks market. 


- **Application Scenario:** This project uses a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/baotramduong/generate-nft-cryptopunks-with-dggan), and this data set is drawn from the Cryptopunks Transaction board using API (DUON 2021). The date of the data set is from 2017 July to 2021 September. The original dataset contains information about the transaction date, the transaction address, the price of Cryptopunks, the gender, and other attributes of the Cryptopunks’ image. I use the percentage change of Cryptopunk price to get the return on investment value, which is the Y variable. And gender and skin tone are X variables. In Figure 2 in the Splotlight section, I visualize the ROI time series data with the x-axis being time and the y-axis ROI values.

- **Methods:**
  - This research uses Ridge Regression to predict the ROI with gender and skin tone factors. Ridge regression is a method for estimating the coefficient of a multiple regression model. Compared to linear regression, this method improves the coefficient estimation accuracy and assigns different weights to the features (Hoerl and Kennard 1970). Using the regression formula with estimated coefficients from Ridge regression, we could conduct prediction.
In python, we could use the ridge regression function (Ridge. coef_), it will return a coefficient of each variable for the regression model. From these coefficients, we could check what’s the influence each gender and skin tone type has on the prediction of Cryptopunks’ ROI. Because gender and skin tone factors are all categorical variables, so we set them as dummy X variables that only have values of 0 or 1. Then the ridge regression formula  is:
$$y=b_{0}+b_{1}*X_{female}+b_{2}*X_{light}+b_{3}*X_{medium}+b_{4}*X_{alboni}$$

  - $b_{0}$ is the expected ROI when the Cryptopunk is in male and dark skin, and $b_{1}$ is the number of increase(or decrease) comparing to $b_{0}$ in ROI when the Cryptopunk is in female and dark skin. If the $b_{1}$ is positive number, that means female Cryptopunks are expected to return higher value for investment. Similarly, $b_{2}$ means the number of increase(or decrease) comparing to $b_{0}$ in ROI prediction when the Cryptopunk is in male and light skin. If the $b_{2}$ is positive number, that means Cryptopunks in light skin tone are expected to return higher value for investment than dark skin. Similar explanation works for $b_{3}$ and $b_{4}$.


- **Expected Results:** I expect that predict ROI should be close to the real ROI as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3 in the Splotlight section, the x-axis is the ROI value, and the y-axis is the counts. So the overall figure shows the distribution of the predicted ROI (in green bar) and real ROI (in blue bar). The more overlapped part of the two ROI data, the more accurate our prediction is. And I also expect that the predicted ROI will be higher for female in Alboni skin tone because the number of Cryptopunks in this type is the least. Because Cryptopunks are only limited to 1000 tokens stored on Ethereum blockchain (Kong and Lin 2021). And Cryptopunks are fixed in total number so the scarceness of this type of Cryptopunks will not be changed in a short time and there is potential for this type of Cryptopunks to increase in price, and thus are expected to have higher ROI (Kampakis and Schaar 2022). The results could be used as reference for investors for picking Cryptopunks according to the gender and skin tone attributes.

Figure 1. The Project Poster (Created by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFT52ikjIs/qxf0zRLnKI7RPB8R7W3j6w/edit))

Figure 1 illustrates six sections of the research: Intruduction to the project background and motivation, research questions, data sources and methodology, intellectual merits, expected Results, and references.


### Literature Review
![Figure 2. The literature of intellectual merits](https://github.com/SunYutongAmber/portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/Splotlight/Stats201%20Final%20Project%20Literature%20Flow%20chart.png)
Figure 2. The literature of intellectual merits (Created by [ProcessOn](https://www.processon.com/diagraming/63915c97e0b34d7ebd80b0f8))

Figure 2 outlines the literature under intellectual merits. Figure 2 shows how I discuss the three lines of literature in aspects of the research question, methodology, and application scenario. The three pink boxes show the SoK/Survey papers for each line of literature. The five grey boxes are the most recent paper related to my resarch topic. And the three white boxes demonstrate what's this paper's unique contribution that differs from previous studies.


### Explanation Figure

![Figure 3. The ROI time series data](https://github.com/SunYutongAmber/portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/Splotlight/Scatter%20Plot%20for%20ROI%20over%20time.png) 

Figure 3. The ROI time series data (source from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/baotramduong/generate-nft-cryptopunks-with-dggan), created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/time-series/))

Figure 3 is the scatter plot of the Cryptopunks' return on investment (ROI) data from 2017 July to 2021 September. The X-axis shows the timestamp and the Y-axis shows the ROI value of average of Cryptopunks in ETH. The line fluctuates between (-1 , 1) around the x-axis with no obvious increase or decrease pattern. As the time approaches to the present time, the fluctuation is more sever and frequent. That indicates that the ROI fluctuate more frequently comparing to the previous ROI data. And the highest ROI value is achieved around 2020 April, the lowest ROI value is reached around 2021 August.


### Prediction Figure
![Figure 4. The expected result of the predicted ROI and the true ROI](https://github.com/SunYutongAmber/portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/Splotlight/Ridge%20Regression%20Predicted%20and%20True%20Value.png)

Figure 4. The expected result of the predicted ROI and the true ROI (source from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/baotramduong/generate-nft-cryptopunks-with-dggan), created by [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.kernel_ridge))

Figure 4 is the histogram of Ridge Regression for Cryptopunks return on investment (ROI) for the prediction value and the true value. For Ridge Prediction, the X variable is the past 10-day moving average of the daily ROI of Cryptopunks, and the Y variable is the future ROT. In figure 4, the X-axis is the ROI value of Cryptopunks and the Y-axis is number of counts. The higher the Y, the more Cryptopunk ROI value is in the corresponding X interval.  Blue histogram bars represent the true ROI distribution and green bars represent the predicted ROI distribution. The histogram could provide an evaluation of the performance of the regression algorithm by observing the overlapping of the two colors of bars. If the blue and green squares are overlapping, that means the predicted results are close to the true value and the model is accurate. However, we could find from the figure 4 that the green bars are taller than blue bars, which indicates that most of the predicted ROI are quite close to zero. That means Ridge is not quite accurate when using the past 10-day moving average of the daily ROI of Cryptopunks as the X variable.

### Self-introduction

This is Yutong Sun, the research assistant at SciEcon CIC and a senior student majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science at Duke Kunshan University. My research interest is in financial technology and financial mathematics. Previously, I have published some research papers on commercial leverage ratios, stock price-predicting, and stock quantitative investment strategy using machine learning models. 

### Final reflections
- In this course, I learn how to apply a various machine learning methods to solve social science issues. For example, we learn explanation the data using visualization tools. We also learn the prediction and classification algorithoms. These algorithoms are frequently used in analyzing social science issue like air pollution prediction using the number of factory in the area, health situation prediction using age et al. In addition, we also learn how to use the past days' moving average of time series data to predict the future time series data. Typical example is the Cryptocurrency price prediction. We should notice that if a variable A could predict another variable B, that does not necessarily mean A coudl cause B. So we also learn Causual Inference algorithom concept to detect whether one event or variable cause another. Many machine learning models could be used to analyze the causuality of some events, and Fast causual inference algorithom is one of them. Besides, we also learn the optimization problem, which means we want to maximize out objective by using reinforcement learning algorithom. A typical social problem that could be solved by this method is maximizing the utility of people by selecting from a bunch of goods. 
- Another important topic we discuss is the ethic issue of AI. Now Computer Programming and algorithms are more and more complicated, and for machine learning, those algorithms are like a black box, as Zeynep mentioned in the TED discussion, we don’t know what happens inside the algorithms (“Machine Intelligence Makes Human Morals More Important | Zeynep Tufekci” 2016). Someone may think using machine learning could avoid human biases, but the truth is that this may be worse.  Because the data we used to feed them is generated by human beings. If the data is biased, then the output may be also biased. If we totally rely on AI for decision-making, we may end up with a biased decision. We could solve this problem by checking the training data set before doing sampling and machine learning. In the future, I plan to contribute to "machine learning for social science" by designing unbiased machine learning models and selecting the training data set cautiously to avoid biased data.
